'''We define a Person class, and the Student class inherits from it. 
Since the Student class requires the same attributes as the Person class, 
we leverage inheritance to reuse those attributes. 
For actions, such as introducing the person, we use the super() function to 
call and refer to the parent classâ€™s methods.'''
